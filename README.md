Presently, I am working on learning and building a foundation on how to use the most popular and essential collaboration and version control tools, including GIT, GITHUB and the Command Line.

Inclusively, I am learning Front End Development + React JS, HTML & CSS, Git & GitHub, Coding Responsive Websites, JavaScript Fundamentals, [JavaScript React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html "Tutorial"), User Experience (UX), and Graphic/Visual Design, including Adobe Creative Cloud.
