### Hi, I'm Brad ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring front-end developer currently studying and refreshing my talents within computer technology.

Presently, I am working on learning and building a foundation on how to use the most popular and essential collaboration and version control tools, including GIT, GITHUB and the Command Line.

I am also working on my website to showcase my portfolio.
