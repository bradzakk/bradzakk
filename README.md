### Hi, I'm Brad ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring front-end developer currently studying and refreshing my talents within computer technology.

Presently, I am working on learning and building a foundation on how to use the most popular and essential collaboration and version control tools, including GIT, GITHUB and the Command Line.

Inclusively, I am learning Front End Development + React JS, HTML & CSS, Git & GitHub, Coding Responsive Websites, JavaScript Fundamentals, [JavaScript React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html "Tutorial"), User Design (UX), and Graphic/Visual Design, including Adobe Creative Cloud.

I am also working on my website to showcase my portfolio: https://tapedeck.ca
